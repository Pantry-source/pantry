How I made pantries table

```
CREATE TABLE pantries (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  user_email text,
  title text,
  description text,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

alter table pantries enable row level security;

create policy "Individuals can create pantries." on pantries for
    insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can update their own pantries." on pantries for
    update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can delete their own pantries." on pantries for
    delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals view their own pantries." on pantries for
    select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
